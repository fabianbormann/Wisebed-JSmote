Javascript Interface for Remote Controlling WISEBED Nodes

The Wisebed Testbed enables the easy deployment of large scale wireless sensor network 
experiments without the need to buy the expensive sensor node hardware. However, 
programmers still have to learn an embedded programming language and put up with the tedious 
debugging characteristics of a large embedded network. To lower these prerequisites for starting 
with the development of sensor network applications (e.g., for students), 
this projects aims at creating a remote control interface for wisebed nodes, 
which allows the easy programming and debugging of these applications inside a Webbrowser.
